# Problem Statement

Multisig transactions are a fundamental aspect of "complex Bitcoin scripting," enabling co-ownership of Bitcoin UTXOs. They play a crucial role in co-custody solutions for Layer 2 (L2) protocols.

L2 protocols commonly initiate by establishing a multisig funding transaction among involved parties. For instance, in Lightning, both parties may co-fund the transaction before conducting their lightning transactions. Upon closing the channel, they can settle the multisig to reclaim their respective shares.

In this exercise, we aim to simulate a basic multisig share transfer between two participants, Alice and Bob.

### Write a bash script to:

#### Setup Multisig

1. Create three wallets: `Miner`, `Alice`, and `Bob`.
2. Fund the wallets by generating some blocks for `Miner` and sending some coins to `Alice` and `Bob`.
3. Create a 2-of-2 Multisig address by combining public keys from `Alice` and `Bob`.
4. Create a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) to fund the multisig address with 20 BTC, taking 10 BTC each from `Alice` and `Bob`, and providing correct change back to each of them.
5. Confirm the balance by mining a few more blocks.
6. Print the final balances of `Alice` and `Bob`.

#### Settle Multisig

1. Create a PSBT to spend funds from the multisig, ensuring 10 BTC is equally distributed back between `Alice` and `Bob` after accounting for fees.
2. Sign the PSBT by `Alice`.
3. Sign the PSBT by `Bob`.
4. Extract and broadcast the fully signed transaction.
5. Print the final balances of `Alice` and `Bob`. `Alice` should be around 3 BTC poorer, and `Bob` 3 BTC richer.
